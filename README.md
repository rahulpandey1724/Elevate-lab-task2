📈 Visualizations Included
Sales & Profit by Region (Bar Chart)
Compare how different regions perform in terms of revenue and profit.

Sales by Sub-Category (Bar Chart)
Shows which product sub-categories generate the most revenue.

Profit by State (Alternative: Bar Chart instead of Map)
Visualizes which U.S. states are profitable or incurring losses.

Sales Over Time (Line Chart)
Displays trends in sales over months.

Discount vs Profit (Scatter Plot)
Shows how discounts impact profitability.

🔍 Insights Summary
The West and East regions contribute the most to total sales.
Technology and Office Supplies are top-performing categories.
Certain sub-categories like Copiers have high profits, while others like Tables often lead to losses.
Some states are running at a loss (e.g., Texas, Illinois) while others are highly profitable (e.g., California).
As discounts increase, profit tends to drop significantly, suggesting over-discounting hurts margins.
🚫 Map Visual Limitation
Due to tenant admin settings, map and filled map visuals are disabled. A bar chart was used as an alternative to show profit by state.
